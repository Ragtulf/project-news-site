# News Site

I struggled with many things. Mainly making the webpage look good in mobile, tablet and desktop. 

## The problem

I started out with a sketch. Then I started coding. After a few hours I decited to go back to the sketch and make it more detailed. I still think that the website could have been better if I had decited more things before starting but then I was so clueless when I started that I couldn't have known about the problems that would appear. So this was a huge learning oppertunity. 
If I had more time I would like to find out how to work with images of different sizes and ratios. I would have liked to put the <h1> on top of the main article image. And I would have finished making the website responsive in a way that I am happy with. 
Next time I will plan sizes before beginning coding and I would try to finish a section before starting the next one (especially if they are similar) to be able to reuse the code and that way I would avoid having to fix the same problems in multiple places.
