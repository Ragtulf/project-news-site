# News Site ðŸ—žðŸ–¤

I struggled with many things. Mainly making the webpage look good in mobile, tablet and desktop. And getting the main article image to be a hero banner with the h1 placed nicely on top.

## How I did it


I started out with a sketch. Then I started coding. After a few hours I decited to go back to the sketch and make it more detailed. I still think that the website could have been better if I had decided more things before starting but then I was so clueless when I started that I couldn't have known about the problems that would appear. So this was a huge learning oppertunity. 
If I had more time I would like to find out how to work with images of different sizes and ratios. I would have liked to spend more time figuring out how to have the main article image as a background. Right now the header is to long in front of the main article image and the h1 needs to be placed better. And I would have finished making the website responsive in a way that I am happy with. 
Next time I will plan sizes before beginning coding and I would try to finish a section before starting the next one (especially if they are similar) to be able to reuse the code and that way I would avoid having to fix the same problems in multiple places.
